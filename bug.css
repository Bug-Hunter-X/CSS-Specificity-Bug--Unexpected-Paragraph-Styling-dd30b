The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon issue where the specificity of CSS rules can lead to unexpected behavior.  The intention is to style all `<p>` elements with a blue background color. However, the more specific rule targeting `<div> p` overrides the general rule, resulting in only the paragraphs within the `<div>` having a blue background, while paragraphs outside remain unaffected.
